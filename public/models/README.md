# Face-API.js Model Files

This directory will contain the model files for face-api.js. These files need to be downloaded and placed here for the face detection and eye blink detection to work properly.

The required model files are:

1. For tiny face detector:
   - tiny_face_detector_model-weights_manifest.json
   - tiny_face_detector_model-shard1

2. For face landmark detection:
   - face_landmark_68_model-weights_manifest.json
   - face_landmark_68_model-shard1

3. For face expression recognition:
   - face_expression_model-weights_manifest.json
   - face_expression_model-shard1

These files will be downloaded automatically when the application runs for the first time.
